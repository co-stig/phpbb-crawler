phpbb-crawler
=============

A simple phpBB forum crawler/parser, designed mostly for scientific purposes. I created it as a part of my MSc research, you can find further details in [report](https://github.com/co-stig/phpbb-crawler/blob/master/master-report.pdf?raw=true) and [presentation](https://github.com/co-stig/phpbb-crawler/blob/master/master-presentation.pdf?raw=true).
